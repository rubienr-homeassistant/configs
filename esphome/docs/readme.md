However its also possible with programmer.

For OTA flashing instructions see: [readme.md](./../nodes/nous-tasmota-to-esphome/readme.md)

**Notes:**

- Never connect to grid and PC! The device is not decoupled from L/N!
- For programming, the PC connection is sufficient.
- The internal Micro-USB connector is not USB compliant (its 3.3V serial)
- GPIO0 is the push button; for Reset, TX and RX see images.
- Metering chip: BL0942
